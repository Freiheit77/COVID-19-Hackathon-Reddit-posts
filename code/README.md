# Code instruction: 

## Outline: 
There are three major sections in the Python script, which include text data collection and preparation, LDA topics modelling, and aggregation data collection. In the first section, [Pushshift API for Reddit](https://pushshift.io/api-parameters/) is used to extract Reddit submissions and comments. The datasets are saved as .csv format. In the second section, three topics models based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are developed and keywords and representative sentences are selected to better understand each topic. In the third section, the number of aggregated Reddit activities is gathered to see [Reddit trendings](https://pushshift.io/).
